- Standardized column names (snake_case).  
- Engineered new columns like:
  - `age_group` – categorized customers into age brackets.  
  - `purchase_frequency_days` – measured repeat purchase intervals.  
- Dropped redundant features (`promo_code_used`).  
- Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL for structured querying.
